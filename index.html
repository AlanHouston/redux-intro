      //all of this data must be contained within one object with a key/value 
      //key is the name of the data "tshirts", value is the actually stuff
      //step 1
      let state = {
        //in this extremely simple example we are just saying that there is a counter
        //does anyone care what the current count is? if it changes to 1 does anyone care ? hello?

      //this is a redux specific thing. 
      //for every key in the state object, you need to make a function with the same name
      //it will always take 2 parameters, state, action
      //state = the value from the state object key of the same name counter = counter
      //action = the message object that was dispatched
      //when you dispatch a message, this function is what will receive the message
      // it then needs to decide how the state should be altered
      //whatever is returned from this function is what will be put into the value of the key in the state object
      //after that is done all subscribers are notified that there is new data

      //step 2.5
      let reducers =  Redux.combineReducers({
        counter//,whatever other reducers
      })
      //step 3
      //we need to create a store, the store holds all the data. like a real life store
      var store = Redux.createStore(reducers,state)
      
      //step 4
      //something has to subscribe to the publisher (store)
      //that something will always be a function
      //the function will be called when some data is changed
      //hey store tell me when the data changed please
